# Geometry

## 110_mesh_shader_triangle
Do the lights turn on? Demonstrates the most absolute basic functionality of a mesh shader.

## 111_mesh_shader_meshlets
Demonstrates how to use [meshopt](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer) to create meshlets and render them using a mesh and fragment shader.

## 112_mesh_shader_amplification
Do the lights turn on? Demonstrates the most absolute basic functionality of a amplification/task shader (D3D12/Vulkan) and object function (Metal).

## 113_mesh_shader_instancing
Demonstrates how to do instancing using amplification. Renders the same model's meshlets in many different locations.

## 114_mesh_shader_culling
Demonstrate how to do meshlet culling during amplification.

## 115_mesh_shader_lod
Do the lights turn on? Demonstrates the most absolute basic functionality of LOD using instance index to select LOD.

## 116_mesh_shader_calc_lod
Demonstrates how to calculate LOD using disance to camera during amplification.

## 117_mesh_shader_cull_lod
Demonstrates how to calculate LOD using disance to camera with meshlet culling during amplification.
